# Privacy Policy for ShelfLife

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

**ShelfLife** is operated by **Eseka Emmanuel** ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy applies solely to the ShelfLife mobile application.

We built this app to help you track your groceries and reduce food waste, not to track you. This policy explains clearly how your data is handled. We believe in transparency and keeping your data necessary, minimal, and secure.

## 1. Information We Collect
We only collect the data required for the app to function properly and remain secure.

**A. Account Information**
* **Guest Mode:** If you use the app without signing in, we create an anonymous identifier to store your pantry items on your device and in our database. No personal names or emails are collected.
* **Google Sign-In:** If you choose to link your Google Account, we authenticate you using Firebase Authentication. We store your Name, Email Address, and Profile Picture solely to identify your account and display your profile within the app.

**B. Your Pantry Data**
* Any items, expiration dates, or photos you upload to your inventory are stored in our cloud database (Firebase Firestore) and storage (Firebase Storage) so you can access them across your devices.

**C. Technical & Crash Data**
* We collect anonymous crash reports and performance data (via Firebase Crashlytics) to help us fix bugs and improve app stability. This includes device type, operating system version, and crash logs.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data solely for the following purposes:
* **Functionality:** To sync your pantry items and images between your devices.
* **Notifications:** To schedule local alerts on your device for expiring food.
* **Security:** To verify that requests are coming from the genuine app (via Firebase App Check).
* **Improvement:** To analyze crash logs and fix technical issues.

**We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to third parties.**
**We do not use your data for advertising purposes.**

## 3. Third-Party Services
We utilize **Google Firebase** as our backend infrastructure provider. Firebase is a secure, industry-standard platform. The specific services we use include:

* **Firebase Authentication:** For secure user login.
* **Cloud Firestore:** For database storage.
* **Firebase Storage:** For storing pantry item images.
* **Firebase Crashlytics:** For reporting app crashes.
* **Firebase App Check:** For API security and fraud prevention.

For more information on how Google handles data, please review the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 4. Data Retention & Deletion
* **Data Retention:** Your data remains stored in the database as long as you have an active account.
* **Account Deletion:** You have full control. You can delete your account and all associated data permanently from within the app:
    1. Go to **Settings**.
    2. Tap **Delete Account**.
* **Timeframe:** This action permanently deletes your data from our active servers promptly (typically immediately, but backup systems may take a short reasonable timeframe to cycle).

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through an update to the app or other communication channels.
